///
/// This function is unsafe because it is an allocation function.

/// # Safety
/// 
/// This function is unsafe because it returns a raw pointer to uninitialized memory without enforcing type safety.
/// The caller must ensure that the allocated memory is used correctly according to the intended data type,
/// and must handle potential null pointers if the allocation fails.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `layout` - A memory layout describing the size and alignment requirements for the allocation.
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// A pointer to the allocated memory, or null if the allocation fails.
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// use core::alloc::Layout;
/// 
/// unsafe {
///     let layout = Layout::from_size_align(128, 8).unwrap();
///     let ptr = alloc(layout);
///     assert!(!ptr.is_null());

/// # Safety
///
/// This function is unsafe because it is an deallocation function.
/// Deallocates a memory block using the bump allocator.
///
/// This function forwards the deallocation request to the global bump allocator. In this
/// bump allocator implementation, deallocation is effectively a no-op. It is the caller's
/// responsibility to ensure that `ptr` and `layout` refer to a valid memory block previously
/// allocated by this allocator.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The caller must ensure that:
/// - `ptr` is a valid pointer returned by a prior allocation using this allocator.
/// - `layout` accurately specifies the size and alignment of the allocated memory.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use core::alloc::Layout;
///
/// unsafe {
///     // Allocate a block of memory.
///     let layout = Layout::from_size_align(1024, 8).unwrap();
